Artificial Intelligence

PLACEHOLDER README

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?<br></br>

Developed the Q-training portion of the model. This was accomplished through utilizing the provided experience replay code to create a training model that utilized exploitation and exploration to solve the treasure hunt maze. 

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?<br></br>

In the field Artificial Intelligence computer scientists act like the parent or a teacher. They take a problem and work to identify actionable strategies for breaking that problem down into manageable parts. In the case of AI these problems are taken a step further as it isn't good enough to simply solve a problem, but instead the computer scientists have to deconstruct the entire process of solving a problem in order to create an intelligent agent capable of doing the same. 

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

As a computer scientist I approach problems from a practical standpoint. I try to clearly identify my goals and my starting point. From there it is a matter of seperating the problem into different components with actionable means of solving them to create a functional system capable of performing a given task. When it comes to ethical responsiblities to the end user and the organization it is always the computer scientists responsibility to ensure fair use that includes user safety and privacy, while also bearing in mind the effects of your product and how they might be used in the real world, and to take steps to prevent said product from marginalizing any peoples.
